## **UX**

<a></a>
### **User Persona**
This website is a tool for users who are teaching Primary Irish “Gaeilge” to their classes. This site includes home page where the learners have the opportunity to learn the words and match to the pictures. The users want to use this website as a learning aid within lessons for visual learners. The users are comfortable with using technology, and through the era of home-schooling it could also support Parents and Teachers alike.

<a></a>
### **Who**
Who are we building this website for?
- Teachers who are teaching interactive lessons or parents who are home schooling at present.

<a></a>
### **User Goals**
- Have a view of the words and pictures what will come up in their memory game and be able to match the words and pictures when asked.
- To see the pictures and words below so they can learn the “Gaeilge” words
- To see what they may already know
- To see the words they need to learn
- Easily find icons for further learning – GaeilgeVibes through social media apps (online)
- To “get in touch” if they have comments or require further information.

<a></a>

### **Site Owners Goals**
- Educational resource to be developed for Primary school children in Ireland to make learning fun and interactive.

### **User Stories - Children**
* As a beginner to the Irish Language, I want to be able to see the picture and word so I can learn this way. 
* As a teacher, I want to make sure that I can challenge the learners in my class by showing them the pictures and asking them say the Irish words. 
* As a user when I play the game I want to see if I can match 2 key cards together and learn the words this way.
* As a teacher, I want to be able to assess my learners on their memory and assessment of their learning of key Irish words. 
* As a user I want to be able to look for further sites/information about Gaeilge.
* As a teacher, I want to be able to find further resources online.
* As a learner/user, I want to be able to get in touch with the webpage-developers to let them know how they could improve this site for my learning.

### **Design**
As the central theme of the website is Gaeilge-Irish, I made all my design choices based on the Irish Flag colours & elements.
I researched images and websites of Ireland, flag, Irish language to get inspiration for the colour scheme.

#### Fonts
I used [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Indie-Flower](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower") Google fonts: Indie-Flower") font. 
I chose this font as it is very similar to a handwriting font and I would expect younger children would be more comfortable with
this font as opposed to a more modern or office type font. It is easy to read and creates a young environment for the pages. 

<a></a>
#### Icons
I used icons from 
[Font Awesome library] (https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). 
The icons that were used are used to give meaning to a certain section - Social Media Icons that are very familiar to all users. 

<a></a>
#### Colours
The colour scheme is based on Ireland/Irish Flag colours. I wanted it to relate to the subject of Gaeilge – Irish language. 
I used #FFA500 for Orange and #008000 for Green in the project. I did use some other colors as background and 
#800000 for message that pops up when the game finishes.

<a></a>
#### Logo
I used a logo using an Irish Flag I found on Google images. (assets/images/irishflag.jpg) 

<a></a>
## **Wireframes**
I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create my wireframes. 
First I created a basic wireframe for mobile & desktop. 
For my website, I have decided to go for a 3-page website which suits young people to navigate directly to key areas.
I did feel if I put my webpage all on 1 page it would be over whelming and the user may get lost looking for the game.

The website will be easy to navigate by using the buttons at the side of the page to bring the user to home/game/get in touch page. 


<a></a>
### Wireframe images:
#### These are both mobile and desktop layouts. So the user can visualise using them on either device. Looking at it completed, I
feel that this website would be used more by a teacher on a whiteboard - so desktop was the best design.
- [home page](wireframes/index-homehtml.jpg)
- [game page](wireframes/gamehtml.jpg)
- [Get in Touch](wireframes/contacthtml.jpg)

<a></a>
## **Features**

it drawas the users attention. 
2. Cards are locked and will only turn when the START button is clicked.
3. Instructions are given to the user to click on the start button to start the game - flashing text.
4. A reset button is also available for users to reset if they want to start the game again.
5. An message will appear when the user matches all the cards to give them information on the time it has taken them, and 
how many flips also.

## **Deployment**

This project was developed using the [Gitpod IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/), 
committed to git and pushed to GitHub using the built-in function within Gitpod. 
After writing the code, committing and pushing it to GitHub:

#### Log into GitHub.
* Navigate to the repository on github and click **Settings**.
* From there, go to the **Source section** within the Github Pages section.
* Select **master branch** on the dropdown menu, and click save.
* Now the website is live on:

```
https://yourgithubusername.github.io/your-repo-name
```
* Any time commits and pushes are sent to Github, the Github Pages site should update shortly after.

To deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Franciskadtt/voyager), the following steps were taken:

At the moment of submitting this Milestone project the Development Branch and Master Branch are identical.

### How to ensure Google API works
The API key is a unique identifier that authenticates requests associated with 
your project for usage and billing purposes. You must have at least one API key associated with your project. 
The API key in t

To create an API key:

1. Google maps require you to restrict your API key to certain URLs. 
Therefore you will have to create a [Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) 
account and get your own key.
2. Go to the APIs & Services 
3. Go to the Credentials page
4. On the Credentials page, click Create credentials. The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.
5. Click Close.
6. The new API key is listed on the Credentials page under API keys. (Remember to restrict the API key before using it in production.)

### How to ensure EmailJS API works

Set up EmailJS account
1. Create an [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) account
2. Create an email template: click on the Email Template section on the left-hand side.
3. Click Create new template up at the top
